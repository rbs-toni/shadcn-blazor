**shadcn-blazor** is an side-project — a Blazor port of port of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), made just for fun.

> **Note**  
> I’m not affiliated with shadcn. I just admire the style and thought it would be fun to try building something similar in Blazor.
> The logo used here is also not affiliated with or endorsed by shadcn.

This project is free, open source, and comes with **no guarantees**. It’s not deeply thought-out, and things may break or change at any time. Use at your own risk — or just poke around for ideas.
